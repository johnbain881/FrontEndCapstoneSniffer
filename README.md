This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief Proposal

Everyone is able to communicate during the tough times of covid-19, 
via the internet but, sadly, our dogs are unable to reach out
to each other to sniff things together! Luckily, I created Sniffer!
This app allows dogs to sniff their thoughts out to other dogs, and
share them with the world! They can follow their dog friends, and 
see what they have been sniffing! They are able to like and resniff 
another dogs sniff and see what other dogs have resniffed too!

## Setup

1. Clone repository
1. `cd` into the api directory.
1. make a file called `database.json`
1. this project uses json server, so run the command `json-server -p 8088 -w database.json `
1. open up another terminal and `cd` into the correct directory
1. then `npm install` in the base directory of the project. 
1. `npm start` in the base directory of the project.
